		<h1>Our Analysis</h1>
		
		<p>Below is a graph showing the distribution of number of hashtags used vs total engagement received by small accounts (1k to 10k followers) and big accounts (more than 10k followers).</p>

		<p>This visualization is done to see general distribution of total engagements received by these accounts and the number of hashtags they used. Intuitively, we see that there is a downward trend when more hashtags are used in a post.</p>

		<p>To quantify this relationship, we fitted a regression line to all the data available.</p>

		<p>The slope of the line (\beta_1) was found to be -0.006874, indicating that for every additional hashtag put into video descriptions,the number of engagements received by the account is reduced by 0.6874%.</p>

		<p>We also performed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression</p>

		<p>We found that the p-value of the t-test is 0.004. With a significance level of 5%, we conclude that the number of hashtags used affects the total engagements received.</p>
